      "The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!\n",
      "\n",
      "My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.\n",
      "for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three.  okay. lets break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "the service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "for lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.\n",
      "\n",
      "that being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\").\n",
      "\n",
      "the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.\n",
      "\n",
      "i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.\n",
      "Love this place. I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French. \n",

      "I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!\n",
      "Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.  Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent.  Also, the food prices\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.   \n",

      "Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins.\n",
      "I've been here for a few dinners and brunches, and it has been a pleasure every time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service has always been very attentive and helpful. For one of the dinners, our group had trouble deciding on dishes so our server suggested that we pick a price point and let the chef put together a menu. It was a really fantastic experience!\n",
      "Ok, full disclosure:  went here as a default because Ascari Enoteca was closed down due to a busted water pipe or something.  \n",
      "Food was AMAZING!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious.  To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, \"Everything is awesome....\"\n",
      "We had an exceptional experience at Table 17. Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort.\n",
      "Found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a Sunday. There was one table available luckily. There wasn't a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! And very out of the ordinary. Service was good too.\n",
      "\n",
      "French toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. It's a delight for the senses, this place.\n",
      "By far my favourite restaurant in the east end. Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list. Great for any occasion!\n",
      "I booked the private room for a small wedding reception recently. We had 14 guests, the room was perfect. Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite was the polenta bolognese. I could eat that for days.\n",
      "I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.\n",
      "I had a nice time at Table 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was busy when we got there. We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 17 had a great vibe to it.\n",
      "The food was good. The servers were attentive. I'd definitely go back.\n",
      "We had the scotch egg and the tomato based eggs. Everything was delish!\n",
      "While I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it's not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared!\n",
      "\n",
      "The americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more. I had on of their $5 mimosas which is something that would keep me coming back weekly if I could !\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things)\n",
      "A perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two \"brunch hot spots\" in the area. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommend this spot!\n",
      "my first time here. Very impressed. Food was very tasty. Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing. So fresh. It came with a side of vegetables and i got some steak fries with it as well.  The service was pretty spot on and we were always asked if  everything was o.k...which it was.\n",
      "Walked in on a cold saturday afternoon round 1330!\n",
      "waitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east.\n",
      "We started with mimosas while studying the brunch menu.\n",
      "Helen was helpful, knowledgeable  and prompt.\n",
      "I ordered the seasonal scramble, which today was chorizo artisanal, and tarragon scrambled fluffyly together with country butter toast. Loved it.\n",
      "My girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good.\n",
      "We then asked for a cheese plate which was only available for dinner.\n",
      "Helen accommodated us with it anyway:\n",
      "*Paillot de chevre\n",

      "A good bottle of sancerre and \"Voila\"\n",
      "$118 for the both of us\n",
      "will come back, loved it!\n",
      "I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in. It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. An all around let down for a place that I had heard was good.\n",
      "Had an enjoyable meal at this Leslieville spot. Menu is light on  vegetarian options but is otherwise diverse. The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint. My pal ate the steak and frites and licked the plate clean. My pomegranate cocktail was so sweet and satisfying\n",
      " that I had two.\n",
      "I've had the pleasure of dining at Table 17 on two occasions. One time we were a group of four and another time it was just me and my husband. The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?) I'd suggest the Bourbon sour. Yummy.\n",
      "I'm going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl's first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn't really taint my evening because the food was excellent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's! I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it's at, at a place like this.\n",
      "I love this place.  It's definitely a little pricey, so it's more of a special occasion place.  Love the décor.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread.  Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate.  Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it's place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"hot balls\" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them.  I can't say I've ever had anything like them before.  There are 3 different types:  Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto.  A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went with the fish (trout) for my entrée.  It was very good.  Nothing special or unique to report.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very impressed with the service here.  I've recommended this restaurant to others, and they've loved it too.\n",
      "Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17. Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won't visit again.\n",
      "Booked through OpenTable a few days before, for 8pm. Zipped right in to our table.\n",
      "Had the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.\n",
      "My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!\n",
      "My friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable. Too bad others had issues, thought our guy was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reservations are definitely recommended, was quite busy.\n",
      "I came here for weekend brunch. We arrived around 11:30 and there was no wait, lots of free tables. It was packed by 12 or 12:30 though. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place is cozy and inviting. It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet. \n",
      "\n",
      "The brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. \n",
      "\n",
      "The whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Street parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour. \n",
      "\n",
      "I checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a \"14 oz. (!!) Heritage Beef Ribeye with hen of the woods mushrooms and mint & orange gremolata\" for my next visit.\n",
      "I'll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest. However, the food was right on the money. Good flavor; prompt service. If you have the money, go!\n",
      "We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish !  Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.\n",
      "I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!). \n",
      "\n",
      "The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem \"fried\" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the \"Sloppy\" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough). \n",
      "My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup.\n",
      "Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!\n",
      "We had...\n",
      "Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.\n",
      "Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.\n",
      "Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.\n",
      "One of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is consistent and the service impeccable. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steak frites are the best in the city. Scallops, duck confit and short ribs are also regular favourites.\n",
      "Literally my FAVORITE new restaurant in the northern hemisphere. I've all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it. \n",
      "Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience. \n",
      "Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular. \n",
      "The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors\n",
      "Kudos.\n",
      "We'll be back soon!\n",
      "The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! \n",
      "\n",
      "-CL \n",
      "\n",
      "PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)\n",
      "On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.\n",
      "This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.\n",
      "Food: 9.5/10\n",
      "Atmosphere: 8/10 \n",
      "Service: 9.5/10\n",
      "Overall experience: 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "A lovely experience overall. Went and ordered:\n",
      "- foie gras appetizer\n",
      "- polenta (main #1)\n",
      "- pasta special\n",
      "\n",
      "All the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service.\n",
      "We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here's your table. Our server was fantastic! I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients.\n",
      "We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both!\n",
      " My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. \n",
      "The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding.\n",
      " All in all an excellent dining experience.\n",
      "This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.\n",
      "We were back here this evening.  Delish!\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it's own.  My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish.  I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!\n",
      "Love this restaurant!!! Awesome brunch, $10 for anything on the menu. My hubby doesn't get super full off of the stuff, but I'm good with the amount. Awesome decor too!!\n",
      "We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.  We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.\n",
      "We had a great time. Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it).\n",
      "\n",
      "The polenta had their \"reindeer sauce\" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible. \n",
      "\n",
      "$400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can't see anything wrong with this place.\n",
      "I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hôte we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more.\n",
      "I wish I could share Avitania B.'s Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down. I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It's 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their \"first-world problems\": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive. At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter's attention.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that they aren't over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I'm a late eater.) The appetizers are where it is at here!\n",
      "Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. I had the Sloppy Giuseppe - Two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of Bolognese sauce. Awesome. I'll definitely be back for that alone.\n",
      "Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as \"Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue\"?! \n",
      "\n",
      "Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. \n",
      "\n",
      "This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.\n",
      "Brunchy time and we have a winner.  To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch.  I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!\n",
      "What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat. \n",
      "\n",
      "First off the \"hot balls\" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito). \n",
      "\n",
      "Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience.\n",
      "Was here for my first time just last week. Loved it. It was highlighted by the Soft Shell Crab and the Hunter's Mash. Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender. I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit. \n",
      "Also, they are very quick to respond to any questions you have via Twitter.\n",
      "Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:\n",
      "The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.\n",
      "\n",
      "My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. \n",
      "\n",
      "We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.\n",
      "If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that's the place to go on a Saturday morning. Make sure to come early as they don't accept reservations for less than groups of 6!!\n",
      "We really enjoyed this place.  Food and service was excellent.  Table 17 has different and unique things to try! I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!!\n",
      "I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn't ruin the experience.\n",
      "Great decor, great food, great drinks.\n",
      "Food was really good, not a huge selection on the menu, but it was also a set menu for the night, so can't comment on the normal menu. Food was very tasty, and there was a very different selection of draft beer, all ones I hadn't heard of, but the one I tried was very good. Will definitly be going back!\n",
      "\"Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,\" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.\n",
      "\n",
      "A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Oysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.\n",
      "Stopped in right after lunch shift for a couple drinks. Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink. That said, they were definitely on the pricey end.\n",
      "Great service, the food and drinks were a miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. \n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine.\n",
      "I went here with a group of 4 late on a friday night at around 9:30 pm. We had a bottle of wine, foie gras, risotto, the ribeye, and a few other sides. Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality.\n",
      "PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great.  The menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise I was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good.\n",
      "Had a travelzoo voucher for this place. Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks \"might as well get your money's worth, right?\". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my \"age\" and our voucher. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. \n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly felt like we were given the \"pretty woman\" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn't be worth it.\n",
      "Rarely do I ever venture east of Yonge. It terrifies me. But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be). \n",
      "\n",
      "Once we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who's making my meal!). \n",
      "\n",
      "I had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). \n",
      "\n",
      "The server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks.\n",
      "Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it's been better and better.  Last time I had the daily quiche and it was good.  Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.  Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness.  Maybe I've just lucked out.\n",
      "I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Serving staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone's plates were well-presented. \n",
      "\n",
      "The decor had rustic charm and we didn't feel crammed in like many small brunch spots. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch? \n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely return to Table 17.\n",
      "The only downside about this place is that somehow I've only just discovered it!\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would absolutely return and recommend.\n",
      "Dropped in on a Sunday for Table 17's BYOW Table D'Hote.  There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.  \n",
      "Table D'hote gives you a  selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it.  \n",
      "Neither of our dishes disappointed.  \n",
      "What we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Service was efficient if not overly friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn't think twice about many repeat visits.\n",
      "The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.  I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about.\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod.  Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).\n",
      "\n",
      "$250 for 4 people with some booze.\n",
      "Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh! \n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren't blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation!\n",
      "The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The good:\n",
      "- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality\n",
      "- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees\n",
      "- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu\n",
      "- They do potato rosti right\n",
      "- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon\n",
      "- Good service both times I've been\n",
      "- Proximity to my house\n",
      "- they use opentable\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad:\n",
      "- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.\n",
      "- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)\n",
      "\n",
      "No funny stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here.\n",
      "This was a nice little surprise.  My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will return.\n",
      "I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. \n",
      "\n",
      "I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. \n",
      "\n",
      "We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!\n",
      "Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. My girlfriend and I stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of food, it's the best part. I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won't come away hungry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bravo guys. Bra-vo.\n",
      "We're regulars here. Delicious brunchs! Delicious dinners! Service is quick and helpful. Is a dressed-up/relaxed place. Bonjour Brioche have a line, come here!!!\n",
      "I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste). What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. \n",
      "\n",
      "And so it goes...\n",
      "\n",
      " I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). \n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.\n",
      "Appetizer:\n",
      "Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint\n",
      "My friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. \n",
      "\n",
      "Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale\n",
      "I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Entrée:\n",
      "\n",
      "Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish\n",
      "Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!\n",
      "I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco.\n",
      "Taste good but bad value. Portions are way too small. We both had a app main and desert and still very hungry.\n",
      "Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service. Bottom line: impossible to go wrong with a visit.\n",
      "Went to a Brunch party and it was so cool and awesome, the food and service where amazing and the stuff where so funny!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Know I here is shut down and closed that's sad :(\n",
      "What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner. Table 17 is intimate, split into two rooms.  The service is very personal but not invasive.  Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and  bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return.\n",
      "I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it's small. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. \n",
      "\n",
      "The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "We might even go back before we leave Toronto  to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of.\n"

      "Disappointing experience.  The restaurant was packed and my friend and I were crammed into a small table where we were basically touching elbows with the tables beside us.  The food wasn't anything special which surprised me - I had been intrigued to try this place for a while but I won't be going back.\n",
      "Went for Sunday brunch. Nacoise salad for me, scramble of the day for my friend.  Waiter had an attitude. Food was good / acceptable. Decor was lovely (especially the bathroom!), however  I wouldn't go back again.\n",
      "Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date.  The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic.  The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with. \n",
      "We were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish.  This is a must at Table 17!  The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a \"ragu\" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour.  It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3.  The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air.\n",
      "As a note, Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer\n",
      "Meh. Service was bad and food wasn't much better. The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed.\n",
      "I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.\n",
      "Had dinner with some colleagues on Monday Dec 30, 13.  The food was ah-ma-zing!!  In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake!  You can't go wrong at table17.\n",
      "I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!\n",
      "\n",
      "My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.\n",
      "Came for brunch with my wife and two young boys on a Saturday. We had the scotch eggs and Giuseppe eggs. They have $4 kids meals too. We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We'll be coming back for sure!\n",
      "What a great little restaurant in Leslieville.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service.  Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city. \n",
      "\n",
      "Call me a fan. I will definitely go back!\n",
      "For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating.  I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind.  Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation.  I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).\n",
      "I have only been for brunch but was impressed.  Very friendly staff.  Somewhat traditional French brunch menu, and well executed items.  They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great.  The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it.\n",
      "All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.\n",
      "We've been here for brunch a couple of times. Had the rosti both times, as well as the neapolitan eggs and the weekly scramble. Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly. Also entirely reasonably priced. Recommended.\n",
      "I've been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding!\n",
      "With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)\n",
      "\n",
      "For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint.\n",
      "I can never resist hot ballZ (sexy menu item here at Table 17).\n",
      "\n",
      "Conveniently located near Jilly's (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it's own dipping sauce. I think these are a \"must have\" if you come here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list is extensive but the price point was a bit over the top - no bottles under $60 and the 1/2 liters started at $45. Apparently on Sunday/Monday you can bring-your-own-wine, but not sure what the corkage fee was.\n",
      "I have been hear a couple of times and overall have enjoyed the food.  I had the trout as my main and it was very fresh and perfectly cooked.  It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying.  Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe.\n",
      "Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.\n",
      "\n",
      "My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work.\n",
      "Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nice wine list. Will return soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times.\n",
      "The things that I liked:\n",
      "\n",
      "Interior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Server was a very lively & attentive British man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent.\n",
      "\n",
      " For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range.\n",
      "My experience with Table 17 were excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shared:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamb Polenta ($14)\n",
      "Duck Confit ($26)\n",
      "Vanilla poached rhubarb ($8)\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was well prepared with great care. I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening. I guess a lot of people were taking advantage of their prix menu $35 during Sunday and Monday with BYOW.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: Thanks Amy L for the invitation\n",
      "wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends! bonus! i didn't know there were coupons and deals at this place as I was reading the reviews but I would still pay full price to come here, gotta try dinner someday. good vibe here, good neighbourhood, good food! no line-ups for brunch either\n",
      "I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that's how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince.\n",
      "My girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil. \n",
      "\n",
      "Glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!\n",
      "I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. \n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to \"walk-in\" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be. We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!).\n",
      "\n",
      "A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!\n",
      "My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)\n",
      "My fiance and I really liked this place. Huge step up from Stonepepper Grill. Our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point. Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?\n",
      "Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \n",
      "I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \n",
      "Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. \n",
      "A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! \n",
      "Well with it.\n",
      "Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. \n",
      "We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. \n",
      "The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+\n",
      "The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B\n",
      "Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! \n",
      "Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. \n",
      "I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu.\n",
      "The wine selection was limited but of good quality.\n",
      "The appetizer Arancini were good but seemed to just be a little bland the tomato sauce helped but it too needed more garlic.\n",
      "My salad had too much vinegar and was drowning in it. \n",
      "The seafood Rollitini was ok but under seasoned.\n",
      "The strawberry mascarpone cake, basically tiramisu with strawberries instead of chocolate, was just good not great. \n",
      "\n",

      "1. Stop seasoning for old white people or at least offer to kick it up\n",
      "2. Go to a team waiting model to give more attention to customers. \n",
      "3. Make us customers feel special not by cupon for free wine but giving a shit, talk to us treat us like we are honored guests.\n",
      "4. Keep the seasonal menu going. \n",
      "5. Offer old fart seating at 4:00 to 5:00 \"give cupon for buy one pay 1/2 price for second \" you can offer the bland \"Special \" then.\n",
      "My husband and I went to Pazzo's for dinner during restaurant week.  We were both disappointed with our entrees.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  We both loved the lobster bisque.  My husband's crab ravioli was not warm.  My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat.  My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner.\n",
      "We loved our experience here tonight.  Kim was our waitress and she was great.  Our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat.  I also have Celiac's disease, so no gluten for me.  Our meals came out just right, they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat.  You have now become one of our new favorite restaurants.\n",
      "This restaurant looks lovely. There are beautiful paintings on the walls. The tables are set nicely. You are greeted kindly. The servers are very nice. The decor/environment and the service is the only reason I can give one star.  It was all downhill after that. \n",
      "I say all the time that of you can't get the basics right you can't get anything beyond the basics right. So we ordered two basic dishes-fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti & Meatballs. We chose to skip appetizers but a family style salad was brought to out table. It included a few cucumbers, a few grape tomatoes, some purple onions and a few croutons. There salad was cold but there was nothing memorable about it. We were also served 2 slices of bread. Again, nothing that stood out. \n",
      "The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our salad. It was awkward. When we went to eat our entrees they were room temperature. The meatballs were over cooked, dry, and didn't seem to have any seasoning. The spaghetti sauce tasted like tomatoes and not much else. I was extremely disappointed. I also tasted the fettuccine. It too lacked flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were inconsistent. Some were cooked to the correct consistency but some were hard. \n",
      "We skipped dessert because we didn't want to take the chance of eating anything else that lacked flavor. \n",
      "It's safe to say that there won't be a second visit.\n",
      "Great food!  Thoroughly impressed with bolognese, manicotti, and veal.  Meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Service needs tightened up, but they're still new.\n",
      "Overpriced and flavroless.  This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick.\n",
      "The perfect word for this place is: bland. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!\n",
      "I can't comment on the food here because we didn't get that far. We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.\n",
      "Save your $22+/ plate & take yourself over to Giant Eagle's Café. \n",
      "\n",
      "It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. \n",
      "\n",
      "The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door.\n",
      "I don't understand the 2 star reviews. Lunch today was very good, especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb.\n",
      "The wedding soup was so good! After eating that I was hopeful that the reviews on here weren't accurate... I'm sorry to say that they are true! I would come back for the soup but wouldn't eat dinner here again. We came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor.\n",
      "I completely agree with Kimberly said. BLAND CITY!!!  Hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers. But I doubt it.\n",
      "So far all the reviews have nailed it- flavorless and cold food. Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a \"family style\" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?\n",
      "I'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the \"lightly breaded\" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be \"diablo\" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..\n",
      "\n",
      "We were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long.\n",
      "First time at this restaurant for my birthday dinner which was less than memorable. Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. \"Hi, just two of you?\"not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back\n",
      "My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value.\n",
      "We had a great experience for dinner a few days ago! The service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu. I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination. From our zucchini appitizer, family style salad, entrees and wine, everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. The courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm,remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes. We will be back!\n",
      "The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign. \n",
      "But still wanted to give it a try. \n",
      "No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. \n",
      "My menu was dirty.\n",
      "My silverware was dirty.\n",
      "Glasses spotty. \n",
      "Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....?\n",
      "Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. \n",
      "These little details could easily be fixed.\n",
      "The worst dining experience I have ever had.  The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks.  When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before.  Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef).  He basically ignored them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out.  At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks.  Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks.  Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves.  A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was.  We had no signs of him until we had to search for him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty.   I can't imagine it will be open long.  If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills.\n",
      "I really don't have too much to say other than the fact that I sent my food back and decided to just grab something to eat somewhere else.  Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up.  Dinner was bland and not even italian food...\n",
      "\n",
      "Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right?  Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley.  The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75  For ketel one and some vermouth.  WOW.   There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews.\n",
      "The food is very good. \n",
      "But...... Bartender charged for a double. Should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00. When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!! They are sneaky and when they get caught, they are unapologetic.\n",
      "If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts. \n",
      "\n",
      "AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there.\n",
      "Review is based on service and bar only - did not order food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Place was empty on Friday night. First warning sign.  My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign. \n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!\n",
      "Dipped cone all the way! This location is tricky because it gets very busy in the evenings. Best route, don't go in the drive-thru, park your car and order inside. It's quicker and easier!\n",
      "Always amazing food and service. Love their chicken Parm sandwich. Their blizzards are awesome too.\n",
      "This place is literally the worst. Hopefully the got rid of the awful management, because the owner is actually sort of nice. I ordered ice cream and just got a sloppy mess and no apology.\n",
      "Very nice and new. Staff is always friendly but the drive thru is ridiculous. Two burgers and a diet soda and Im still sitting here 10 minutes after the fact? People have stuff to do. I could cook a meal at home in this time.\n",
      "Nothing special about this place, their ice cream is ok. On busy nights drive thru is insane and impossible to turn left out of here. Prices are high too. The employees are really nice and it is a clean store.\n"
