# Duke_ECE590_08
This repository contains the collected files for the final project of ECE590-08.

There are three folders:

## In menuGeneration: ##

    We used bidirectional LSTM to extract the food name in texts.
## In word2Vec: ##

    We implemented the skipgram word2vec model. We have used materials from one of assignments in Stanford University cs224d. 
## In restaurantsTypeClassification: ##
  
    We implemented two models to predict the type of restaurants basing on the reviews. One the Naive Bayes, another LSTM.
