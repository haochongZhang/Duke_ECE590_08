# Duke_ECE590_08
This repository contains the collected files for the final project of ECE590-08.
(As the Yelp dataset files are too large to upload to this github, we didn't upload them. Therefore, some parts of our codes can not run because they rely on the raw data filesï¼‰

There are three folders:

## In menuGeneration: ##

    We used bidirectional LSTM to extract the food name in texts.
## In word2Vec: ##

    We implemented the skipgram word2vec model. We have used materials from one of assignments in Stanford University cs224d. 
## In restaurantsTypeClassification: ##
  
    We implemented two models to predict the type of restaurants basing on the reviews. One the Naive Bayes, another LSTM.
