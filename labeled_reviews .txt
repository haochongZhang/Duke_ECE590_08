it	O

sooo	O
good	O
the	O

gave	O
it	O
a	O
sweet	O
kick	O
that	O
went	O
so	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
rice	U

i	O

with	O
everything	O
and	O
my	O
son	O
orders	O

both	O
sour	B
cream	L
and	O
guacamole	U

all	O
rice	U
and	O
beans	U
no	O
steakand	O
a	O
bbq	B
chicken	L
burrito	O

bland	O
boring	O
and	O
the	O
chicken	U
was	O
way	O
to	O
drythe	O
guacamole	U
and	O
chips	U
please	O
chips	U
in	O
a	O

i	O
ordered	O

in	O
my	O
burrito	O
and	O
got	O
black	O
beans	U
the	O
salsa	O
bar	O
is	O
gone	O
now	O
so	O
you	O
cant	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
you	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
burrito	O
because	O
when	O
you	O
ask	O
for	O
salsa	O
you	O
are	O
given	O
one	O
cup	U
that	O
contains	O
two	O
spoonfuls	O

so	O
i	O
ordered	O
a	O
black	O
bean	U
veggie	O
burrito	O
chips	U
and	O
a	O
drink	O
and	O
paid	O
extra	O
for	O
a	O
side	O
of	O
sour	B
cream	L

the	O
burrito	O
and	O
ingredients	O
and	O
cheese	U
tasted	O
great	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
any	O
veggies	U
except	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
table	O
spoons	O
of	O
sauteed	O
veggies	U

it	O
had	O
way	O
more	O
rice	U
and	O
beans	U
then	O
chicken	U

the	O
only	O
complaint	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
the	O
chips	U
for	O
the	O
queso	U
theyre	O
the	O
cheap	O
and	O
gross	O
yellow	O
circle	O
chips	U
that	O
you	O
get	O
at	O
a	O
movie	O
theater	O
or	O
a	O
carnival	O

we	O
ordered	O
the	O
fish	U
burrito	O
to	O
split	O
chips	U
and	O
queso	U
and	O
two	O
modelos	O

i	O
got	O
the	O
chicken	U
and	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
rice	U
they	O
totally	O
skimped	O
on	O
the	O
chicken	U
and	O
added	O
hardly	O
any	O
veggies	U

i	O
usually	O
order	O
the	O
steak	U
taco	O
salad	O
w	O
refried	O
beans	U
and	O
guacamole	U

kind	O
of	O
a	O
bummer	O
because	O
i	O
want	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
peppers	O
and	O
zucc	O
in	O
my	O
rito	O
but	O
kinda	O
awesome	O
because	O
beans	U
rice	U
tomatoes	O
cheese	U
various	O
veggies	U
lettuce	O
sour	B
cream	L
and	O
guac	O
should	O
be	O
enough	O
for	O
my	O
belly	O

my	O
tofu	U
burrito	O
was	O
definitely	O
different	O
the	O
tofu	U
did	O
not	O

choice	O
the	O
bbq	B
chicken	L
and	O
steak	U
was	O
the	O
same	O
price	O
so	O
i	O
chose	O
the	O
beef	O
of	O
course	O

he	O
asked	O
and	O
i	O
confirmed	O
no	O
beans	U
no	O
rice	U
no	O
guac	O
no	O
cheese	U
nothing	O
but	O
steak	U
cilantro	O
wrapped	O
in	O
a	O

and	O
some	O
chips	U
and	O
salsa	O
the	O

but	O
i	O
like	O

i	O
got	O
the	O
chicken	U

and	O
my	O
date	O
got	O
the	O
cheese	U
and	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
skimp	O
on	O
the	O

i	O
was	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
heft	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
was	O
disappointed	O
it	O
was	O

sides	O
beans	U
rice	U
spinach	U
chips	U
quest	O
guac	O
and	O
sometimes	O
they	O
have	O
soup	O

i	O
assumed	O
that	O
the	O
bbq	B
chicken	L
would	O
be	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
grilled	O
chicken	U
not	O
just	O
chicken	U
with	O
bbq	O
sauce	O
at	O
extra	O

i	O
ordered	O
just	O
a	O
basic	O
bean	U
cheese	U
and	O
rice	U

but	O
whenever	O
i	O

i	O
think	O
this	O

is	O
overrated	O
and	O
cool	O
just	O
because	O
people	O
say	O
it	O
is	O
and	O
because	O
yeah	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
funny	O
name	O
its	O
incredibly	O

i	O

the	U

to	O

despite	O

it	O

of	O
our	O

with	O
the	U
perfectly	O

that	O

over	O

with	O

and	O
mizuna	O
not	O
off	O
to	O
a	O

the	U
arancini	U
were	O
were	O
deliciously	O
cheesy	O
and	O
crispy	O
but	O
the	U
accompanying	O

was	O
problematic	O

not	O
only	O
were	O
the	U
lobster	O
pieces	O
incredibly	O
overcooked	O
but	O
the	U

itself	O
was	O
so	O

if	O

had	O

into	O

this	O

the	U

of	O

the	U

was	O

i	O
have	O
to	O

took	O
my	O

about	O
the	U

as	O
an	O

if	O
